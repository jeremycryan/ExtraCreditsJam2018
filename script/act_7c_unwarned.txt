The dragon hesitates

#Dragon

You say my presence is causing death? I have killed no one from your town. I have hardly left this mountain since arriving, you have no reason to blame me for their misfortunes!

#Benethir
/Calm
That can't be true. Ever since you arrived, the mountain has gotten hotter and hotter!
Fire spouts into the sky and burns where it falls! How is that not your fault?

#Dragon
/Calm
I see. This mountain has been erupting as of late, but my presence on this mountain is not to blame.

#Benethir

... That must mean the fire comes from the mountain itself.

I have said already that I have no interest in killing your people, warrior.
I do not want to kill anyone, nor to do I desire to constantly fight knights who arrive on my doorstep with the wrong idea.
I will leave. Goodbye brave warrior.

#Benethir
/Calm
... Bye Molog.

Benethir stands back and watches as Molog flaps his wings and rises into the air.
Soon, the huge dragon is nothing but a red dot in the sky.
