Nothing stops a warrior once he has spotted his foe. Benethir rips through the undergrowth and cuts down the man before he can so much as scream.

Huff, well that was easy. Wait a minute... a priestly robe, an easy fight?

 It is not until the old man lies unmoving that Benethir realizes that this old man is no bandit, he is a priest gathering herbs in the woods.

Do you mean to tell me I knocked out this old man for no reason!?

#Benethir
/Annoyed
You are a terrible guide, sir sprite.

Well, no matter. This potion will be helpful for the both of us.

Benethir leans over to wipe his sword off on the grass. He drains the potion in one gulp and drops the flask next to the priest's body.
