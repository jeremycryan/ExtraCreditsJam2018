It looks like my sprite provided some help after all! That's good. I'm proud.
You look like you've gotten a little scorched there my friend; why don't I see to that before you inform the guild of your victory?

#Benethir

Perhaps... but you have done well my friend, you don't need my help.

Benethir nods, though he does not look wholly convinced.
You listen as the two chat about their old adventures.
