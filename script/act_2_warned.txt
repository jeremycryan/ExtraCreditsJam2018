The first arrow whizzes toward Benethir. He catches it in his fist and strikes down the first bandit. The second bandit attempts bury his knife into the warrior, but the warrior dodges the assault and strikes.
Benethir grins as he advances onto the third bandit, the one who had been unlucky enough to jump into the middle of the road.
