Knock, knock!
Yo Hiens!! Its me, open the door!


#Hiens

Hold your horses Benethir, I'm coming.
Good afternoon.

#Benethir
/Confident
I got a mission from the guild. We're killing The Dragon of Burning Mountain.

#Hiens
/Busy
You mean you're killing The Dragon of Burning Mountain. I am staying right here and studying.

#Benethir
/Annoyed
Can't your books wait for once? Hiens?

#Benethir
/Annoyed
It's for the guild, Heins.

#Benethir
/Defeated
Fine Hiens, have it your way. I could easily handle this myself.
I just thought it would be fun to go with a friend.
/Default
It's always better to adventure with someone you trust!

#Hiens
/Touched
Oh... I'm touched.

#Hiens
/Default
But I'm sorry, I can't go.

#Benethir
/Angry
Fine! Whatever. I'll be on my way then!

#Hiens
/Hands Raised
Hold on, hold on. Let me get you something.

#Hiens
/Default
Take this with you. I'm far too busy to assist in person but this tiny creature can serve as a guide. This sprite will provide useful tips and aid you in a variety of ways.

#Benethir
/Annoyed
It can't even wield a sword, how is this supposed to help me?

#Hiens
/Busy
Hmmm... Perhaps it won't be of much help. But regardless, it at least will keep you company.

#Benethir
/Annoyed
Uh, thanks Hiens... I'll take this thing with me, but when I'm in the middle of battle facing down foes without backup, I'll be thinking of you.
/Eager
Come on then little fella, let's go slay a dragon.
