"Yo Hiens! Its me open the door."

"Afternoon."

#Benethir

I got a mission from the guild. We gotta kill the dragon of burning mountain!

#Hiens
/Default
Not me. I'm mid way through my studies and must focus. Can't you recruit someone else for this task?

#Benethir
/Annoyed
Come on, Hiens, it's for the Guild.
/More annoyed
Hiens?
/Defeated
Okay Hiens, I'll be honest. I could handle this mission solo style, but you are my friend, it'll be that much more enjoyable to go on this mission with someone I trust. Put that spoon away and let's go.

#Hiens
/Touched
Oh... I'm touched.
/Default
But I won't go.

#Benethir
/Angry
Fine Hiens, be that way!

#Hiens
/Hands raised
Hold on, hold on. Let me get you something.
/Default
Take this with you. I'm far to busy to assist in person, but this tiny creature can serve as a guide. This sprite can provide useful tips and can aid you in variety of minor ways.

To be honest, it might not be very helpful but at least it'll keep you company.

#Benethir
/Angry
Err... Well thanks... I'll take this thing along with me, but when I'm in the grips of battle and this whatever you called it doesn't help, I'll be thinking of you.
/Eager
Come little fellah, let's go.
