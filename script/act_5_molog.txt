WHO DARES ENTER THE DOMAIN OF MOLOG THE MIGHTY?

Maybe you weren't as stealthy as you thought.

#Benethir
/Confident
It is I! Benethir the mighty warrior! You threaten my home and for that you shall be slain!

#Dragon
/Default
I Molog, threaten your home!? Your rumors mean nothing, knight. I know your kind, you are here for nothing but your own glory. Leave while you have the chance, puny human, those who trespass in my domain do not survive.

#Benethir
/Angry
Your presence alone threatens a great many villages, dragon. On behalf of the villagers and in the name of my guild, I'll remove threats like you from the world!

As Benethir talks, fire gathers in the dragon's mouth.
